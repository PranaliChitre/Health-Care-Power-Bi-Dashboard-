# Health-Care-Power-Bi-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard for healthcare can visualize demographic data about patients, including patient wait lists, doctor specialties, and their ages. This dashboard offers insights into patient demographics such as age, gender, and location, combined with their wait times for various specialties. By integrating these metrics, healthcare administrators can identify patterns and trends in patient demographics, optimize resource allocation, and improve service delivery to meet the specific needs of different patient groups. This facilitates more effective and targeted healthcare management and planning.
